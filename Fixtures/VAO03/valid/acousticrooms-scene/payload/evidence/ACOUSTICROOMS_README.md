## 🏠 Overview

**AcousticRooms** is a large-scale synthetic room impulse response (RIR) dataset designed for cross-room RIR prediction tasks. It includes over **300,000 single-channel RIRs** simulated across **260 rooms** spanning **10 categories**, such as apartment, auditorium, office, and cafe. Each room features high-quality 3D spatial geometry and randomized material properties drawn from a diverse library of **332 acoustic materials** across **11 categories**.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 260 professionally designed 3D room geometries from 10 room types
- Over 300K high-quality RIRs simulated using hybrid acoustic simulation (wave + geometric)
- 332 real-world acoustic materials randomly assigned to room surfaces
- Diverse room sizes (20 m³ – 1000 m³) and layouts
- Source-receiver configurations with spatially valid random sampling

## 🔬 Simulation Setup

### Acoustic Modeling

Simulations are run using the **[Treble](https://www.treble.tech/)** acoustic simulation platform in hybrid mode:
- **Wave-based simulation** for low frequencies (< 710 Hz)
- **Geometric-based simulation** for high frequencies (> 710 Hz), using:
  - Image-source method up to order 4 with 50k rays
  - Stochastic ray-tracing for higher orders with 5000 rays
- RIRs simulated until 60dB energy decay

### Source & Receiver Placement

- 10–100 omnidirectional sources and 25–100 monaural receivers per room
- Placement constraints:
  - ≥ 0.5m from surfaces
  - ≥ 1.0m between sources
  - ≥ 0.5m between sources and receivers
- Valid locations sampled using spatial point-picking algorithm

### Material Assignment

- Surfaces (walls, floor, ceiling, furniture) are semantically labeled
- Each label mapped to one of 11 material categories
- Randomized selection of specific material with realistic acoustic coefficients from a library of **332 materials**
- Diverse acoustic properties across geometrically similar rooms

## Usage for RIR prediction task
**AcousticRooms** is used as a benchmark for cross-room RIR prediction task in the paper. If you are interested in this task, please check out the third-party implementation of the xRIR framework proposed in the CVPR paper at https://github.com/DragonLiu1995/xRIR_code.
